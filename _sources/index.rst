What is web scraping?
:::::::::::::::::::::
 
The internet is full of information people would like to collect. Copying and pasting it would take forever! How can we get that information with code?

 *Web scraping* involves fetching a web page and extracting data from the page.

In this curriculum you will learn with *plans*
:::::::::::::::::::::

During this lesson, you will learn common patterns used by real professionals who do web scraping. These patterns are called "plans". 

.. admonition::  What is a **plan**?
   
   A plan has the following parts: code, a goal, slots, and subgoals.

These 10 plans are based on real practice. The plans were created after an anaylsis of 100 web scraping files from Github, a place where people store code files, as well as two interviews with people who use web scraping in their jobs. These plans represent the most common patterns in web scraping with BeautifulSoup.
